//we can concat two strings using + operator

"hai" + "there"  //result=" hai there"

//example

val nofish=10
val noplants=20

"We have $nofish fish and $noplant plants" //we have 10 fish and 20 plants
		or
"We have ${nofish+noplants} fish and plants"  //we have 30 fish and plants


//we can compare two strings that return bool-true/false

val fish="fishhh"
val plants="plantss"

fish==plants		//false
fish=fish			//true
fish!=plants		/true



//using if-else

val nofish=10
val noplants=20

if(nofish<noplants) println("more plants")
else println("more fish")				//more plants



//ranges in Kotlin

val fish=50
if(fish in 1..100) prntln("yes")	//yes


//ex2:

when(numberOfFish)
{
	0->println("empty tank")
	50->println("full tank")
	else->println("perfect")
}						//full tank
